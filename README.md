# Tuneable-Laser-Controller
A Controller for the RGB Values and Duty Cycle for a Tuneable Laser/LED.

Intended for this Laser. It is likely fine for a lot of other Lasers, maybe.

It shows the RGB values and the Duty Cycle (0-255) on the 1602 (with backpack) display.

The colour assignments are kind of wonk becaues of my particular LED.

Adjust as needed.
