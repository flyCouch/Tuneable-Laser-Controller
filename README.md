# Tuneable-Laser-Controller
A Controller for the RGB Values and Duty Cycle for a Tuneable Laser/LED.

Intended for this Laser. It is likely fine for a lot of other Lasers, maybe.

It shows the RGB values and the pause interval in microseconds (0-255) on the 1602 (with backpack) display.

I believe this version will work as intended. I am still waiting for my laser.

This is a work in progress.

Will keep it updated, hopefully.
