# Tuneable-Laser-Controller
A Controller for the RGB Values and Duty Cycle for a Tuneable Laser/LED.

Intended for this Laser. It is likely fine for a lot of other Lasers, maybe.

It shows the RGB values and the Duty Cycle (0-255) on the 1602 (with backpack) display.

The colour assignments are kind of wonk becaues of my particular LED.

Adjust as needed.

Also, to get the desired colour, you might have to go 255-desiredRGB.

I have not yet got this laser but my other laser is like that.

Work in progress.

Will keep it updated, hopefully.
